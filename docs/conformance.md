# Conformance

## Conformance

`conformance/vectors.json` is the specification: 14 language-agnostic vectors, each an input and
the result any implementation must produce. `conformance/check_vectors.py` checks this one.

```bash
python3 conformance/check_vectors.py
```

The refusals are most of the suite, because they are what a reimplementation gets wrong — and
getting one wrong converts a refusal into a false assurance, which is worse than the missing
feature. An empty suite exits 2 rather than reporting success.
